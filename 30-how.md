## How to create reproducible research?

## Habits

- Reproducibility from Day 1
- Adopt reproducible habits
- Take notes when you do things, not after
- Use version control

## Tools

- Use [Template README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/)
- Learn programming tricks that help streamline processing
- Save files and tables programmatically

## When to learn?

- Undergradudate students
- Graduate students
- Junior faculty
- Senior faculty
- ... anybody

## Tips

- Before finalizing, **run everything from scratch**
- **Computational empathy**: think of the next person to run this
  - It could be **you** in 5 years!

## Advanced tools

- Use environments
- Use containers
- Plan for failure

## These are not barriers!

- Use of Excel for tables
- Manual processing (in limits)
- "I am not a programmer"
- Confidential data

## Most of these have simple solutions!
